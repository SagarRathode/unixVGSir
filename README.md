2. UNIX is mother of all operating system   -""-

3. UNIX is for the developer,by the developer,of the developer -""-

4. C,C++,Java programing language born by UNIX(UNIX is rewrite in c)
        java born on solaris and solaris is unix based (james Gausling)
        (java people are unix ---- java black book steven holzner)


5. Three Database born on unix informics,cybase,Oracle   (DBA u must know unix sumitbha das book)

7. still today unix is the most secured o.s (linux GNU std)

8. unix is very small ,so small it can fit with half of small floppy(512kb) (16kb OS system 8kb user programs and 64kb maxfile size limit) still it can serve multiple 1000s(multiuser in workstation environment)

9. UNIX can run from nailtop computer to supercomputer(highly portable)
unix (27 underline) network address (222.222.222.222 write algorithm unix)sumitbha das (BSD UNIX invented  TCP/IP) human readable format to network address

10. "Unix is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity." â€“ Dennis Ritchie




11. There are 13 root name servers which drive whole planet internet (clusters) all those machine BSD Unix (berkley software distribution)

12. UNIX is based upon on lifes phylosiphy (dennies ritche and ken thompson ,kaare christian unix documentation ) files have spaces and processes have life ---- kaare christian  file - body seen process - soul
